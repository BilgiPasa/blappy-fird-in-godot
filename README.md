# blappy-fird-in-godot

This is a Flappy Bird clone that I made for to learn the Godot game engine.

I made a game named Blappy Fird long time ago using the Unity game engine. This is the Godot implementation of that game using Godot 4.6.

This game is open source and licensed with the MIT licence.

I wrote the code of the project myself. I did not vibe code.

The code of the Unity game that I mentioned is here: https://github.com/BilgiPasa/ScriptsOfBlappyFird

TODO:

* Use Godot 4.6.1 instead of Godot 4.6.

* Add sounds to the game because this game has no sound.
