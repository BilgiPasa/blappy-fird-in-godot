# blappy-fird-in-godot

This is a Flappy Bird clone that I made for to learn the Godot game engine.

I DID NOT use any Generative AI prompt to make this project. Also, I don't like using Generative AI and I don't recommend using it.

I made a game named Blappy Fird long time ago using the Unity game engine. This is the Godot implementation of that game using Godot 4.6.

This game is open source and licensed with the MIT licence.

The code of the Unity game that I mentioned is here: https://github.com/BilgiPasa/ScriptsOfBlappyFird

TODO:

* Add sounds to the game because this game has no sound.
