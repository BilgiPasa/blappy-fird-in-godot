If you want to pause the game, instead of using "Engine.time_scale = 0", I recommend you to use
"get_tree().pause = true" and setting the process modes of the nodes that you want to pause and not pause.
Also, make the root's process_mode as Node.PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS if you are going to stop the game. Because if
you don't, you can't unpause the game.

If you are going to disable a node that you are getting the signal from in the signal emit function:
    1. Make a new function

    2. Move the code in the signal emit function to inside of the new function that you made.

    3. Write new_function_name.call_deferred() inside of the signal emit function.
    (Write the function name of the new function that you made to new_function_name.)

Example code:

func _on_x_body_entered(_body: Node) -> void:
	disable_x.call_deferred() # Use call_deferred like this.

func disable_x() -> void:
    x.process_mode = Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED
